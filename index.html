   <h1>Dragon Project Revision</h1>
   <p>Changes that I made in the revision: <br>
   1) max-width: This was a suggestion made by Dr. Wallace and I think it made the content flow better. 
   I added it to "p" element on my css stylesheet and was able to take out many of my "br" elements. <br> 
   2) Buttons: This was a suggestion from my peer review. The review suggested switching the position of the 
   buttons that linked to other pages with the Title of the page. I tried it and like the way it looked so I used it. 
   The flow was much better because the buttons no longer broke up the content of the page. When I did this, I 
   realized that I needed to make the buttons wider and the font bigger. This allowed me to use one "button" element on my 
   css stylesheet instead of three. <br> 
   3) SpaceX Logo. This suggestion also came from my peer review, but I did not use it. He suggested that the SpaceX
   logo blended in too well with the background. I disagree and actually think that it makes the design look sleeker. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    If I  were to do this project again, I would 100% plan it out before writing any code. I know Dr. Wallace said many
    times that planning out the design will save so much time, but I did not listen. I found myself writing a design to all pages, 
    then deciding that something else would look better and having to changes all of the pages coding because of it. The draft 
    took me longer than I think it should of, and maybe with better planning I could of made it look better.

    <h1>Thoughts on Progressive Enhacement</h1>  
     <p>
         Progressive Enhacement is taking more than just content into consideration when building a webpage. It's looking at an overall design
         and accomplishing that using CSS and Javascript. In order for a web page to be visually pleasing, you would need to fully embrace this 
         idea and use it. Unlike GD, PE uses layers and requires planning on the web developers part. The end goal is to take simplicity and make 
         it complex. To read more on this: <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/progressive-enhancement-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it/">

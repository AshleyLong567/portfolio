  <p>Hello everyone and thank you for visiting my page. My name is Ashley Long and I am a full time student at UALR working towards my Bachelors in Information Science.
    As well as being a full time student, I am also working full time on Little Rock Air Force Base. I am currently in the Air National Guard and this September will make 
    5 years in the service for me. When I am not working or doing homework (which seems rare these days), I love to exercise, hike, and travel. My main goal in life is to be 
     financial stable enough to travel whenever I want to. I am very excited for you to check the rest of my page out and see my work. </p>
